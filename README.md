### Overview: 

This dataset collects informationfrom 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the 
question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

* ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us onwhat day the patient set up theirappointment.
* ‘Neighborhood’ indicates thelocation of the hospital.
* ‘Scholarship’ indicateswhether or not the patient isenrolled in Brasilian welfareprogram Bolsa Família.
* Be careful about the encodingof the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, 
  and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
